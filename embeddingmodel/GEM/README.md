# GEM: Graph Embedding Methods
GEM is a Python module that implements many graph (a.k.a. network) embedding algorithms. GEM is distributed under BSD license.

The module was developed and is maintained by Palash Goyal.

## Implemented Methods
GEM implements the following graph embedding techniques:
* [Laplacian Eigenmaps](http://yeolab.weebly.com/uploads/2/5/5/0/25509700/belkin_laplacian_2003.pdf)
* [Locally Linear Embedding](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/lectures/ml/lle.pdf)
* [Graph Factorization](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40839.pdf)
* [Higher-Prder Proximity preserved Embedding (HOPE)](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0184-ouA.pdf)
* [Structural Deep Network Embedding (SDNE)](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0191-wangAemb.pdf)
* [node2vec](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0218-groverA.pdf)

A survey of these methods can be found in [Graph Embedding Techniques, Applications, and Performance: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02801).

## Graph Format
We store all graphs using the [DiGraph](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/reference/classes.digraph.html) as **directed weighted graph** in python package networkx. The weight of an edge is stored as attribute "weight". We save each edge in undirected graph as two directed edges.

The graphs are saved using `nx.write_gpickle` in the networkx format and can be loaded by using `nx.read_gpickle`.

## Repository Structure
* **gem/embedding**: existing approaches for graph embedding, where each method is a separate file
* **gem/evaluation**: evaluation tasks for graph embedding, including graph reconstruction, link prediction, node classification and visualization
* **gem/utils**: utility functions for graph manipulation, evaluation and etc.
* **gem/data**: input test graph (currently has [Zachary's Karate graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club))
* **gem/c_src**: source files for methods implemented in C++
* **gem/c_ext**: Python interface for source files in c_src using [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html)

## Dependencies
GEM is tested to work on Python 2.7.

The required dependencies are: Numpy >= 1.12.0, SciPy >= 0.19.0, Networkx >= 1.11, Scikit-learn >= 0.18.1.

To run SDNE, GEM requires Theano >= 0.9.0 and Keras = 2.0.2.

## Install
The package uses setuptools, which is a common way of installing python modules. To install in your home directory, use:

    python setup.py install --user

To install for all users on Unix/Linux:
    
    sudo python setup.py install

## Usage
Run Graph Factorization on Karate graph and evaluate it on graph reconstruction:

    from gem.embedding.gf import GraphFactorization as gf
    from gem.evaluation import evaluate_graph_reconstruction as gr
    grom gem.utils import graph_util

    # Instatiate the embedding method with hyperparameters
    em = gf(2, 100000, 1*10**-4, 1.0)

    # Load graph
    graph = graph_util.loadGraph('gem/data/karate.edgelist')

    # Learn embedding - accepts a networkx graph or file with edge list
    Y, t = em.learn_embedding(graph, edge_f=None, is_weighted=True, no_python=True)
    
    # Evaluate on graph reconstruction
    MAP, prec_curv = gr.evaluateStaticGraphReconstruction(graph, em, Y, None)
